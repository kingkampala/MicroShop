# MicroShop
MicroShop is an e-commerce platform built using a scalable microservices architecture, designed for performance optimization and enhanced security. Each microservice handles specific functionalities such as user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, and more. This project showcases best practices in Node.js backend development, microservices design, and deployment automation using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Key Features**:

* Scalable microservices architecture
* Secure communication between services with TLS/SSL
* Performance optimization through caching and efficient database queries
* CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

**Features**
* **User Authentication and Authorization**:

  * Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
  * Password hashing using bcrypt for user security.
  * Role-based access control for different user privileges.

* **Product Management**:

  * Full CRUD functionality for managing product listings.
  * Product filtering, searching, and pagination to optimize browsing.

* **Order Management**:

  * Seamless order creation and tracking.
  * Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).

* **Microservices Architecture**:

  * Independent services for user, product, and order management, facilitating easier scaling and maintenance.

* **API Rate Limiting and Caching**:

  * Redis integration to handle rate-limiting and caching for optimal performance.

* **Security and Best Practices**:

  * Input validation using middleware.
  * Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
  * HTTPS setup and usage of secure headers.
